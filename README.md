## Description
This is a simple embeddable poll widget built using React Vite. It allows users to vote on a question and see the results. The poll data is stored in `localStorage`.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Open `index.html` and `test.html` in the `dist` folder to see the poll widget with different questions.

## Technical Choices
- Used React for building UI components.
- Used `localStorage` to save votes.
- Created a responsive design using CSS.
- Made the widget reusable with different questions and options.
- Ensured multiple polls can be displayed on the same page

## Improvements Needed
- Add animations for voting and showing results.
- Enhance the design with more advanced CSS.
- tests cases
